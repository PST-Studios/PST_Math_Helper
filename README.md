# PST_Math_Helper
A C# WPF program that helps with mutiplication by displaying up to x20 of whatever number is input into the program.

In order to use the program, just locate the EXE file in the /bin/Release folder and open it.

Input any number (preferably less than 3 digits due to screen size restrictions) and click the GO button to have 1 X INPUT up to 20 X INPUT.

This program is useful if you need to see each next step but don't want to search or go through each calculation through a calculator program.
